I got the idea to make this game because me and the kiddos had just gone to an arcade that had a 'Whack-A-Mole' and the kids loved it. I just put a more 'adult' twist on it in which insted of moles we wack problems!!!
This was a game I made using HTML, CSS, and, JavaScript. The purpose of this game was for me to practice some different concepts and ways to accomplish specific tasks. I learned quite a few different techniques and I know 
will be valuable in the future.
